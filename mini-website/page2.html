    <h2>The Paper</h2>
    <p>Sets of origami paper are sold widely in sets including 1000 (or more, in case of mistakes.) Sheets of paper, string, and beads are often used to place at the end of each string to stop the cranes from slipping off. Commonly the cranes are assembled as 25 strings of 40 cranes each.
    The size of the origami paper does not matter when assembling a thousand paper cranes, but smaller sheets consequently yield smaller and lighter strings of cranes. The most popular size for senbazuru is 7.5 by 7.5 centimetres (3.0 in Ã— 3.0 in). Some people cut their own squares of paper from anything available, such as magazines, newspapers, notebooks, and printer paper.</p>
